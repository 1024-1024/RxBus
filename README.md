RxBus - An event bus by [ReactiveX/RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)/[ReactiveX/RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
=============================
This is an event bus designed to allowing your application to communicate efficiently.

I have use it in many projects, and now i think maybe someone would like it, so i publish it.

RxBus support annotations(@produce/@subscribe), and it can provide you to produce/subscribe on other thread 
like MAIN_THREAD, NEW_THREAD, IO, COMPUTATION, TRAMPOLINE, IMMEDIATE, even the EXECUTOR and HANDLER thread,
more in [EventThread](rxbus/src/main/java/com/hwangjr/rxbus/thread/EventThread.java).

Also RxBus provide the event tag to define the event. The method's first (and only) parameter and tag defines the event type.

Usage
--------

Just 2 Steps:

**STEP 1**

Add dependency to your gradle file:
```groovy
compile 'com.hwangjr.rxbus:rxbus:1.0.2'
```
Or maven:
``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.hwangjr.rxbus</groupId>
  <artifactId>rxbus</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
  <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

**TIP:** Maybe you also use the [AndroidKnife/Utils/timber](https://github.com/AndroidKnife/Utils/tree/master/timber) to log your message, you may need to exclude the timber:
``` groovy
compile ('com.hwangjr.rxbus:rxbus:1.0.2') {
    exclude group: 'com.hwangjr.utils', module: 'timber'
}
```
en
Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/).

**STEP 2**

Make RxBus instance is a better way:
``` java
public static final class RxBus {
    private static Bus sBus;
    
    public static synchronized get() {
        if (sBus == null) {
            sBus = new Bus();
        }
        return sBus;
    }
}
```
Or just use the provided:
``` java
com.hwangjr.rxbus.RxBus
```

Add the code where you want to produce/subscribe events, and register and unregister the class.
``` java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    ...
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        ...
        RxBus.get().register(this);
        ...
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        ...
        RxBus.get().unregister(this);
        ...
    }
        
    @Subscribe
    public void eat(String food) {
        // purpose
    }
        
    @Subscribe(
        thread = EventThread.IO,
        tags = {
            @Tag(BusAction.EAT_MORE)
        }
    )
    public void eatMore(List<String> foods) {
        // purpose
    }
    
    @Produce
    public String produceFood() {
        return "This is bread!";
    }
    
    @Produce(
        thread = EventThread.IO,
        tags = {
            @Tag(BusAction.EAT_MORE)
        }
    )
    public List<String> produceMoreFood() {
        return Arrays.asList("This is breads!");
    }
    
    ...
}
```

**That is all done!**
